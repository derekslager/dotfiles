# Overview

Derek Slager's local configuration files. Currently contain a
developer-focused Emacs configuration which relies on package.el for
extended functionality.

# Installation

Clone the repository locally (the specific location isn't important).

    $ git clone https://github.com/derekslager/dotfiles

Once cloned, use one of the provided scripts to symlink into your home
directory (move existing files out of the way first). You can also
selectively symlink specific portions of the configuration. On
Linux/Mac, use:

    $ cd dotfiles
    $ ./install.rb

On Windows (Vista or better required):

    > cd dotfiles
    > install.cmd
