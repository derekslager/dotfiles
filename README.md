My local configuration files. Currently contain a developer-focused
Emacs configuration which relies on package.el for extended
functionality.

# Installation

Clone the repository locally (the specific location isn't important).

    $ git clone https://github.com/derekslager/dotfiles

Once cloned, use the script to symlink into your home directory (move
existing files out of the way first). You can also selectively symlink
specific portions of the configuration.

    $ dotfiles/install.rb
